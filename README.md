Counter-Strike to IRC Logbot

The Counter-Strike to IRC Logbot will receive any actions from an Counter-Strike (maybe from any other Half-Life based game) and send it to an IRC-Channel. It will provide detailed statistics and show coloured live-stats.

It was developed for Counter-Strike 1.6 and QuakeNet IRC. It was last updated in 2001, so no guarantee that it is still working.
